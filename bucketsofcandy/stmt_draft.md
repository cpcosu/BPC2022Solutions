You are preparing buckets of candy for the children that are about to come around the neighborhood, as Halloween is soon. As children have allergies, they don't want their candy contaminated with a different kind of candy. So, each bucket must only hold one type of candy. To help from having over-filled buckets you distribute the candy types into multiple buckets. This will reduce the maximum amount of candy that appears in any of the buckets. Your goal is to figure out the lowest that maximum value can be by splitting the candy between all the given buckets. But remember, no cross contamination between the candies.

# Input

The first line contains two numbers B and N, where the first number B is the number of buckets (1 ≤ N ≤ B ≤ 1000000), and the second number N is the number of different candy types (1 ≤ N ≤ 200000). <br><br>The following N lines each contain a number X, the amount of that type of candy (1 ≤ X ≤ 200000).

# Output

One number, the lowest possible maximum when splitting the candy up between the buckets.
