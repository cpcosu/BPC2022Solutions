## Description

Kraft has an arrangement of candy in his mind that he would like to gift to his friend. Kraft knows how to construct a rectangular box of any height and width, and he would like to place the candy into that box. To save on materials, Kraft would like to know what the minimum perimeter of a rectangular box containing the arrangement can be. Note that while the arrangement of candy should not change, the box can be rotated and translated.

## Input

First line is one integer N, 5 ≤ N ≤ 100000 denotes the number of points on the polygon. The next N lines will have two float numbers X and Y, -1000 ≤ X, Y ≤1000 representing each point.

## Output

Output the minimum perimeter rounded to the nearest integer. It is guaranteed that the fractional part of the answer will not be between 0.4 and 0.6.
